# about

this project aims to have a very small ecommerce platform for small businesses

the main idea is to be able to deploy this in very limitted hardward and with very small configuration

# features

## admin management

* product management
* cart visualization
* order tracking and "management" through manual updates

## storefront

* category list page
* product search page
* product details page
* cart
* checkout with a mock payment gateway so that you can configure yourself

# installation

The following is just a wish for now, but hopefully:

* as everything will be dockerized, you should in theory just `docker compose -f compose-file.yaml`
* TODO talk about configuring https - hopefully will be through certbot or something like that
* TODO describe env vars and configuration files needed for this to work

# usage

TODO to be updated once we have something going
